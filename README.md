======================================

Library and basic examples to connect your Java based device to Lhings:
http://support.lhings.com/

The library needs Java 5 or newer.

Maven is used for development, compile with `mvn compile`. To generate a jar file, execute `mvn package`. If you use Maven in your own project, you can use the Lhings library adding the following dependency to your pom.xml:

	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.lhings.java</groupId>
		<artifactId>lhings-java</artifactId>
		<version>2.4.1</version>
	</dependency>

To learn how to develop with this library read the [quick start tutorial](http://support.lhings.com/Getting-started-tutorial.html) and the [javadoc](http://lhings.github.io/java_lhings_library/). You can find further help in:
